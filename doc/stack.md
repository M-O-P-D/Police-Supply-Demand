# Model Stack 1

Single process:
NetLogo must run in neworder's (virtual)env.

*neworder* requires an enhancement (to enable halt/resume) for this approach to work efficiently

# Model Stack 2

Separate processes:

- Netlogo police suppy ABM 
- *neworder* crime microsimulation model


Each run as a standalone process. This allows them to run more efficiently as they can (in practice not?) each continue running while the other model is busy, but means that exchanging data is slightly more difficult.

When the NetLogo model is run, it requests the microsimulation to initialise, then *subscribes* to synthetic crime datasets produced by it. The microsimulation *subscribes* to parameter adjustments coming back from from the upstream ABM.

On initialisation, the microsimulation performs one timestep, *publishes* the synthetic crime dataset, and waits for a response.

Once received, it is consumed by the ABM until fully processed. The ABM can then *publish* adjustments/variations to the microsimulation parameters (e.g. making some crime types more or less probable) which the microsimulation incorporates in computing subsequent crime datasets.  and then awaits an updated dataset.

Communication between the two models is brokered by [*redis*](https://redis.io/), using its *pubsub* (publish-subscribe) functionality.

## Prerequisites

Assumes python 3 on system

```bash
sudo apt install redis-server
```

### NetLogo

Download netlogo from [here](https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/6.1.1/)

e.g. for linux use the script [get_netlogo.sh](../get_netlogo.sh)

### neworder

```bash
pip install neworder
```

## Run

```
./NetLogo\ 6.1.1/NetLogo
```
